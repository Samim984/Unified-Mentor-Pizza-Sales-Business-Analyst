🍕 Pizza Sales & Seating Utilization Analysis

This project was developed as part of my Business Analyst Internship-Unified Mentors
The objective was to build an interactive dashboard for Plato’s Pizza (New Jersey) to analyze sales, seating utilization, and operational efficiency, and propose data-driven solutions.

✅ Sales Trends – Orders, Revenue, Pizzas per Order, Average Order Value
✅ Category Insights – Best & Worst-selling Pizzas by Size & Ingredients
✅ Seating Utilization – Hourly vs Daily demand vs available 60 seats
✅ Customer Behavior – Dine-in vs Home Delivery, Cash vs Online Payments
✅ Business Solutions – Targeted offers & delivery optimization with impact

🎯 Key Insights

Peak Load: 2–10 PM → severe seat shortage (~2,168 per week).

Underutilization: 10–11 AM → ~58 seats free daily.

Category Mix: Veggie pizzas dominate volume but lower margins; Chicken & Supreme higher margins but declining.

Customer Split: Payments ~50% Cash vs 50% Online; Delivery ~70% vs Dine-in 30%.

Impact Solutions:

🎯 BOGO (Chicken & Supreme) in low hours = +$325/day net.

🥗🍗 Bundle offers (Veggie + Chicken) = +$500 margin/month.
